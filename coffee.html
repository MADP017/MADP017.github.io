<h2>History</h2>
    <p>Coffee is a brewed drink prepared from roasted coffee beans, which are the seeds of berries from the Coffea plant.
cofee plant, which was discovered in Ethiopia in the 11th Century, has a white blossom that smells like jasmine and a red, cherry-like fruit. Back then, the leaves of the so-called "magical fruit" were boiled in water and the resulting concoction was thought to have medicinal properties

<h2>Drip</h2>
<p>Water seeps through the ground coffee, the paper filter, and is then collected in a container placed below a holder used for drip brewing.</p>

<h2>Latte</h2>
<p>Brewed coffee is made by pouring hot water onto ground coffee beans, then allowing to brew.
Lots of steamed milk with espresso shots to liven it up, usually topped with about 1/2 inch or so of foam. Extra foamy lattes would get more foam, depending on how much you specify, or you can order it without foam. But remember, the milk is steamed so unless you've got a veteran barista, you might still get a tiny bit of foam in your milk. If you can't get enough creamy foam, order a cappuccino. Lattes aren't sweet on their own, most people drink them plain or add sugar. A lot of people order them with a flavored syrup, like vanilla. For something different, try caramel, toffee nut peppermint, raspberry, or hazelnut
Espresso and lots of milk, sweetened with mocha sauce, or white chocolate syrup, topped with whipped cream. Always a favorite!</p>

<h2>Machiato</h2>
<p>The word Macchiato is Italian for "marked" and the caramel macchiato is named this because the espresso is added to the drink last, leaving an espresso mark on the top of the foamy milk. Macchiatos are made with vanilla syrup, milk, espresso shots and topped with caramel sauce. The espresso added to the top gives it a stronger flavor when you first sip it, but combined with the caramel syrup, it tastes wonderful! The vanilla at the bottom ends this beverage on a yummy note. One of the most popular drinks!</p>
